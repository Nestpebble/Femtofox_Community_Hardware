## 3d Printed Parts
These are some designs for a bracket to hold the IPEX/u.fl connector in place. There's a few flavours to choose from:

* 30db radio module only
* all radio modules
* with an extra bracket to hold an SMA adaptor on a 25mm pigtail
* Basic spacer on the back
* A spacer with two slots for mounting (3mm and 5mm thick variants

There are files for two variants of an SMA wrench, too.
